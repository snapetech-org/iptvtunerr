# Current task: Unraid distribution and release follow-ups

- **Goal:** finish distributing IPTV Tunerr on Unraid Community Applications and submit the root template through the Community Applications portal.
- **Story IDs:** DIST-001 through DIST-006 in [work_breakdown.md](work_breakdown.md). DIST-003 was withdrawn.
- **Scope:** `iptvtunerr.xml` and `ca_profile.xml` live in the repository root; there is no separate Unraid package repository.
- **Out of scope:** Tunerr runtime features and claiming fixed hardware requirements without measurements.
- **Current status:** v0.1.92 is released (Plex proxy owner-token hardening, SeerrNG recording rules, dependency bumps, Docker Go 1.26 fix); `master` and the `latest` image are kept aligned with the newest stable tag by `.github/workflows/sync-stable-refs.yml`. The Chocolatey publisher failed at its push step with 403; the repository's configured secret is `CHOCO_API_KEY`, which is being rotated from Proton Pass and republished. The PPA publisher fails with "No secret key" until its GPG signing secret is restored; the GitLab mirror still rejects pushes (unpacker error).
- **Next steps:** confirm the Chocolatey republish for `v0.1.92`; run Unraid's portal Validate and Scan, then submit; verify install/update/removal on an Unraid host.

## Completed one-off update (2026-10-02)

- Rotated the Discord release announcement endpoint in the GitHub Actions `DISCORD_RELEASE_WEBHOOK` secret for `snapetech/iptvtunerr`. Verified the secret name is listed and its endpoint ID is absent from tracked files.
